# PackageLoader

just another package manager for `laravel` nothing more and nothing less

but if you want to use it you are welcome

## Use case
use this loader if:
* you want a system to manage migrations parallel to the laravel one
* you cannot use the laravel system to mount service providers from composer
  * for example your packages can be enabled or disabled dynamically by the user

## Pros
* you can write your own package loading strategies
* you can write your own parallel migration strategies (although I recommend to use the one that is already built-in)
* you can write your own package recovery mode

## Documentation

You can find the full documentation at [this location](./doc/README.md)

## Stress Tests üòç

I have tried to reduce loading times to reasonably low times

obtaining good results

* Load 10 packages : ~2 milliseconds
* Load 100 packages : ~10 milliseconds
* Load 1000 packages : ~400 milliseconds

you can find the stress test in this test: `tests/Stress/StressTest.php`

## TODO
* automatic translation management
* publish to composer packages
* Write doc
